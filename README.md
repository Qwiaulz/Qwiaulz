# 👋 Hi, I'm Eugene Qwiaulz

I'm a student who develop **own projects** instead of just doing assignments.

My main interest is **designing systems**:
- how features interact with each other
- how users discover functionality
- how permissions, UX, and automation coexist without chaos

I focus on:
- 🧠 product thinking
- 🎛️ UX flows & interaction design
- 🏗️ system architecture & integrations

Implementation is done with the help of AI tools.
I use them as an instrument — not a replacement for thinking,
but a way to move faster from idea to working system.

- UX decisions are as important as code
